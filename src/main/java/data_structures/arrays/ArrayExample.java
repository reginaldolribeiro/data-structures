/**
 * An array is a collection of items of the same variable type that are stored at contiguous memory locations.
 * Itâ€™s one of the most popular and simple data structures and is often used to implement other structures.
 * Each item in an array is indexed starting with 0.
 * Each element in an array is accessed through its index. This allows for efficient retrieval and modification of elements.
 * Elements are stored sequentially in memory, which allows for efficient traversal and processing of elements.
